In this case we train 
    our model using
        various medical parameters
            such as
                the blood insulin level,
                    blood glucose level, BMI etc.

Once data is fed to
            the Support vector Machine model
                it plots the data on a graph
                    & once plotted it 
                        finds a hyper-plane (i.e seperates data into 2 extremes)

When new data is fed to this SVM model
            it classifies it into either one of the extremetis
                and with that
                    it can predict whether a person 
                        is diabetic or non-diabetic
                
WorkFlow : 1) Import Diabetes Data : diabetes.csv
           2) Data Pre Processing : Standardizing all the data to a single range.
           3) Train-Test Split : 0.8(Train) : 0.2(Test)
           4) Feeding data to SVM Classifier
           5) Obtain Trained SVM Classifier : new data 
                                              check prediction
